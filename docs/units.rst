A note on units 
=================

We work in a nanometer, gram, second unit-space to, well, match the scale of the system we are working with. This means that we use conversion factors to get from mks units to our system. Our common units include piconewtons (:math:`1 g*nm^2/s^2`). Conversion factors for common units are:

* Joules (:math:`1 kg m^2/s^2`) multiply by :math:`10^{21}` to get it in :math:`pN*nm`
* Poise (:math:`1 g/cm s`) multiply by :math:`10^-7` to get it in :math:`g/nm s`
